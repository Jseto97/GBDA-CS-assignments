 INSTRUCTIONS
 Start the program off by either pressing P which will flash colours across the buttons,
 or click on any of the circles ( I suggest clicking on the middle on the last!!!!!)
 
 First circle is a function called noisy painter,
   emulating a snow effect it paints using an ellipse to the mouse position and you can hit the 
   6 key to change the colours and allow it to flash
 
 Second circle is a surprise video that plays and goes of the screen, and automatically resets itself each time
 
 Last circle is a visual piece that uses noise to generate points across the screen to the beat of 
 edm (electronic dance music)
 hit the e and r keys to change the type of points displayed 
 move the mouse to increase or decrease the speed. inorder for more lines to appear you must keep the mouse moving at all times
 
 
 CODING QUALITY AND DESIGN
 
 Rational behind my project. 
 
 I found processing to be and extremely interesting program that allowed the user to really create digital media art using various mediums,
 particularly the interaction between sound and visual design. My program incorporated the elements of various processing tools such as
 noise generation and colour and hue blending to create an interactive audio visual experience that encapsulates what i've learned over the course.
 I utilized a user created object and user defiend functions in an indepth manner to further the interactivity of my project.
 
 Mapping was used to interact with the way my designs appeared on the screen, interactive with the mouse position
 
 User defined functions utilized a combination of elements such as arrays and conditionals to build my stunning visualization of media, blending in various effects
 to overall enhance its aesthetic.
